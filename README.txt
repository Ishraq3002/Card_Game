The Java program simulates a simple card game where 2 - 4 players can play and whoever gets the highest card randomly in terms of rank scores a point. Whoever scores the most point in 4 tries wins!

1) In the beginning, the program provides 2 options to the user for starting/ending the game.

2) Once the user starts the game, the program prompts the user to select the number of players for the game.

3) After the number of players has been selected, the game starts and prompts the user to display available cards.

4) The user has to choose among the options provided and one card randomly gets chosen as Card Selected by the player.

5) The process continues depending on the number of players and whoever has the highest card in terms of rank wins the round.

6) The game continues upto 4 rounds and whoever scores the most point in these 4 rounds wins the game.

7) If there is a tie between players, the game ends as a draw.
